# Symfony 5 with Bootstrap 5 and URL Manipulation

This is a 'Ready-to-Use' Symfony 5 Project which includes Bootstrap 5, SASS and a .htaccess, which 

manipulations the url, so 'myProject/public/index.php/helloWorld' turns into 'myProject/helloWorld'.

After forking run following commands:

    composer install
    npm install

For compiling of the webpack assets directory I recommend using 'npm run watch'


Or you can use the following screenshot

Any Styling or JavaScripts have to be in the assets directory and atleast called in app.js or app.scss

Have fun !

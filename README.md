# Symfony 5 with Bootstrap 5 and URL Manipulation

This is a 'Ready-to-Use' Symfony 5 Project which includes Bootstrap 5, SASS and a .htaccess, which 

manipulations the url, so 'myProject/public/index.php/helloWorld' turns into 'myProject/helloWorld'.

For the working stylesheets (in general building the assets) I recommend running 'yarn encore dev-server'. This will allow you to update your 

code without refreshing the page.

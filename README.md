# Ready-To-Use Symfony 5 project with Bootstrap 5, JQuery, SASS

After forking run following commands:
- composer install
- npm install 

For compiling of the webpack assets directory I recommend using 'npm run watch'


Any Styling or JavaScripts have to be in the assets directory and atleast called in app.js or app.scss

Have fun!
